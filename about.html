            <p>Since our founding, we have supported over 500 children with school uniforms, helped 200 students excel in their studies through extra classes, and nurtured over 100 young athletes.</p>

            <h3>Success Stories</h3>
            <p>"My son was struggling with his studies, but after ScholarsSA helped with extra classes and a new uniform, he became more focused and motivated. He’s now passing all his subjects and has found a new sense of pride in his education." – Bhethi Mashabela</p>
            <p>“When my daughter received a new school uniform from ScholarsSA, it gave her a boost of confidence. She now feels proud to go to school and has become more active in class. I’m so grateful for their support.” – Parent of a Scholar</p>
            <p>"Before joining ScholarsSA, I struggled in math, and it made me feel like I wasn’t good enough. The extra classes helped me so much, and now I’m one of the top students in my grade. I feel more confident and excited about learning!" – Thabo, Grade 11</p>
